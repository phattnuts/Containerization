# Containerization
This project is a basic showcase of my containerization skills.
In this project I:
- Build and containerize applications using Docker.
- Deploy containers to Kubernetes (Minikube).
- Integrate Helm for managing deployments, services, and persistent storage (PV and PVC).
- Implement a basic CI workflow to automate testing and deployment processes.
